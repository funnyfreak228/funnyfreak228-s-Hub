# funnyfreak228-s-Hub (Stable & BETA 1.0.7 Released!)
# The One And ONLY Open-Source Bloxfruits script! 
This is a solo project, so developing takes time, if possible, it would be awsome if roblox developers started taking part on this project!
(Contributions are appriciated)

# Load the script
```lua block loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/funnyfreak228/funnyfreak228-s-Hub/refs/heads/main/funnyfreak228'sHub-Stable-Releases", true))()```
# Load the beta script (Usually more features)
```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/funnyfreak228/funnyfreak228-s-Hub/refs/heads/main/funnyfreak228'sHub-BETA-Releases", true))()```
